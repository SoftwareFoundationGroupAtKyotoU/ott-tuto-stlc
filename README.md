# An example of using [Ott](https://github.com/ott-lang/ott) with LaTeX
This project demonstrates how to use Ott to describe a type system with LaTex. You can also check out [the official user guide](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/ott/top2.html).

If you want to create a skeleton project, you can use [ott-paper-template](https://github.com/gfngfn/ott-paper-template) by [gfngfn](https://github.com/gfngfn).

## Setup
1. Install opam (see https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
2. Install omake and ott

opam install omake ott
```
