  The syntax for expressions in an untyped lambda calculus \cite{Pierce2002}
  is defined by:
  \[
    [[e]] ::= [[x]] \mid [[fun x . e]] \mid [[e @ e]]
  \]
  where \([[x]]\) ranges over the countably infinite set of variables.
  For brevity, we often use \emph{let-expressions} \([[let x = e1 in e2]]\)
  as a syntactic sugar for \([[(fun x . e2) @ e1]]\).
